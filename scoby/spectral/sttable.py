    Spectral Type Table
    Wrapper class for Sternberg and Martins tables.
    This class appeared previously as S03_OBTables in sternberg.py. Since
    reading in the Martins tables is a nearly identical task, I have generalized
    this class.

    The main class method here is lookup_characteristic.
    You should be able to give the "spectral type tuple", which is
    something like ("O", "7.5", "V"), and you can call for characteristics
    in the table.
    The characteristic lookup will first try to match your spectral type
    exactly, and next will interpolate using the "spectral type to number"
    map that Vacca used.
